## About Me

Hi there! I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, the University of New South Wales (UNSW). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Salil Kanhere and Prof. Gustavo Batista.

## Research Interests
My research interests are focused on the uncertainty of machine learning models, dataset shift, and time series analysis.

- **Uncertainty:** Calibration, Calibration Metrics, Calibration of Deep Neural Networks 
- **Dataset Shift:** Label Shift Estimation, Quantification, Prior Adaptation
- **Large Language Model:** Uncertainty Estimation for Open-ended Generation, Cascading, Large Language Model Sampling
- **Time Series:** Time Series Classification, Multivariate Time Series Classification

## News
- **[July. 2025]** I will be attending UAI 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!
- **[May. 2025]** Our paper about calibration is accepted to UAI 2025!
- **[May. 2025]** Our paper about prior adaptation is accepted to KDD 2025!
- **[Feb. 2025]** Our paper about time series classification is accepted to PAKDD 2025!
- **[Dec. 2024]** Our paper about label shift estimation is accepted to SDM 2025!
